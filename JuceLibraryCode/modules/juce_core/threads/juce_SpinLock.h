/**
    A simple spin-lock class that can be used as a simple, low-overhead mutex for
    uncontended situations.

    Note that unlike a CriticalSection, this type of lock is not re-entrant, and may
    be less efficient when used it a highly contended situation, but it's very small and
    requires almost no initialisation.
    It's most appropriate for simple situations where you're only going to hold the
    lock for a very brief time.

        This will block until the lock has been successfully acquired by this thread.
        Note that a SpinLock is NOT re-entrant, and is not smart enough to know whether the
        caller thread already has the lock - so if a thread tries to acquire a lock that it
        already holds, this method will never return!

        It's strongly recommended that you never call this method directly - instead use the
        ScopedLockType class to manage the locking using an RAII pattern instead.
